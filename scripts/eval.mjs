/**
 * Response-quality evaluation for the log analysis tools.
 *
 * Drives the *built* server over real stdio, so what is asserted is the bytes an
 * agent actually receives - TOON encoding included. The jest suite cannot do
 * this: it maps `@toon-format/toon` to a JSON stand-in, so it verifies field
 * shape and nothing about the payload.
 *
 * Four things are checked for every (tool, fixture) pair:
 *
 * 1. Answerability - a realistic user question is only answerable if the fields
 *    it needs are present. Shrinking a response must not cost an answer.
 * 2. No duplication - a figure reported once costs once. No top-level scalar may
 *    be restated in prose.
 * 3. Token budget - a per-case ceiling, so bloat fails instead of creeping.
 * 4. Golden files - the exact payload, committed, so any shape change is a diff
 *    a reviewer can read.
 *
 * Four more are checked once per run:
 *
 * 5. Definition budget - what `tools/list` costs on every request, per tool and
 *    in total, measured over the whole wire object the client receives.
 * 6. Selection keywords - the words a client's tool search matches on, so a
 *    trim that saves tokens cannot quietly cost discovery.
 * 7. README blocks - the published figures, the parameter tables and the shape
 *    of each response are generated from this run, so a change that moves any
 *    of them fails until the README is regenerated with it.
 * 8. Startup cost - listing the tools must not load the Salesforce SDK, which
 *    is five times the rest of startup. Only this sees the built output.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/eval.mjs            # assert
 *   node scripts/eval.mjs --update   # rewrite the golden files
 *   node scripts/eval.mjs --report <log>   # token report for one log, no assertions
