 * `database 0` beside `database NONE` means the queries were not logged, and
 * beside `database FINEST` means none ran.
 *
 * `level` is empty where the log's header declared none for the category, which
 * is most logs for `dataAccess`. A level has no zero, so empty says unstated
 * rather than off - naming a default would state a level the log did not, and
 * `NONE` typechecks, so the goldens are what hold the cell empty.
 *
 * A last `unattributed` row holds the time no event spans, such as the time
 * between the `USER_INFO` line and the transaction. No category gates it, so
 * its level is empty. With it, the rows add up to the whole log.
