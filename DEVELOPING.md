# 🛠️ Developing the Apex Log MCP Server

Welcome to the development guide for the **Apex Log MCP Server**. This document will walk you through the steps required to get started with the development environment, run the server locally, and contribute to the project.

- The source code is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
- The tools directory contains the source code for the functionality available on the server.
- The salesforce directory contains a set of utilities for connecting to a Salesforce org.

## 🔧 Prerequisites

Before you start developing, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- **Node.js** v22 or above: [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- **[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)**: Preferred package manager
- **[Salesforce CLI](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/salesforcecli)**: This is used to connect to a Salesforce org.

Once you’ve got these ready, you’re all set to get started! 🚀

## 💻 Setting Up the Development Environment

To get started, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies.

1. **Create a fork of the repository first**
2. **Clone the repository:**

   ```zsh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/debug-log-analyzer-mcp.git
   cd debug-log-analyzer-mcp
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   Use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) to install project dependencies:

   ```zsh
   pnpm i
   ```

4. **Optional: Set a default org (apexlog_execute_anonymous tool only)**

   The execute anonymous Apex tool requires a default org to be set using the Salesforce CLI. To do this in a repository that has no `sfdx-project.json` like this one, set your default org globally:

   ```zsh
   sf config set target-org <username-or-alias> --global
   ```

5. **Optional: Install MCP Inspector**

   This will allow you to view a UI to easily interact with the MCP server:

   ```zsh
   npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
   ```

## 📦 Building

You can build the server and prepare it for local development, run the watcher to re build automatically or production use. Here's how:

1. **Watch Build:**

   To build the server and then watch for file changes for a fast dev experience, use:

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

2. **Production Build:**

   To build the server, use:

   ```bash
   pnpm run build
   ```

## 🚀 Running the Server Locally

Once you’ve built the server or run the watcher, you can run the MCP server for testing and development.

1. **Run in terminal:**

   ```zsh
   pnpm run start
   ```

2. **Run in MCP Inspector:**

   ```zsh
   mcp-inspector node dist/index.js
   ```

3. **Run against a production org:**

   All eleven tools are available by default. A write against a production org - running Apex, deleting logs, or creating or deleting a trace flag - needs a per-call confirmation, or this flag; a read does not:

   ```zsh
   node dist/index.js --allow-production-orgs
   ```

   To disable Apex execution altogether, use `--no-apex-execution`. To refuse named orgs or whole org types, whatever `--allow-production-orgs` says, use `--deny-orgs`. See the [README](README.md#production-safety) for the full policy.

## 🔤 Naming Tools and Fields

A name has to be decidable: for any new tool or field, exactly one name follows from these rules. The
reader is an agent that cannot ask what a name means.

### Prefix every tool with `apexlog_`

Unprefixed names collide across servers. `get_issue` and `list_issues` ship in both the GitHub and the
Sentry server; `search_files` and `read_file` in both Filesystem and Google Drive. A client with two of
those loaded cannot tell them apart.

One unbroken unit - `apexlog_`, not `apex_log_`, as `slack_` is - so the boundary between the namespace
and the verb is visible.

### The verb states the shape of the result

The result is what the caller plans around. The work is invisible to it.

| Verb | The caller gets back |
| --- | --- |
| `get_` | one or more things, each named by the input: by id, or as a count of the latest |
| `list_` | a collection; filters, thresholds and ranking are allowed |
| `search_` | a collection matched to a query the caller supplies |
| `create_` / `update_` / `delete_` / `write_` | one resource, written; a `delete_` may name several, by id or by the filters of its `list_` |
| `execute_` / `run_` | an effect outside this server |

A filter does not make it a `search_` - Sentry's `list_issues` and GitHub's `list_pull_requests` both
take filters. `search_` is for a caller's query string.

Banned: `analyze`, `process`, `handle` and `manage`, because they name work, so two tools can both
claim them; `find`, `detect`, `check` and `fetch`, because they are synonyms of the verbs above.

The noun states what the result is, in the caller's words: `slow_operations`, not `timed_nodes`.

A bare noun (`apexlog_summary`) is shorter, and `git_status` shows it can work - but only because git's
subcommands *are* its vocabulary, so `status` reads as a verb there. Ours is not, and a bare noun
cannot say whether one thing or many come back.

### Fields

1. **Name the fact, not the calculation**: `returnedSelfPercentage`, not `coveredSelfPercentage`.
2. **Carry the unit** when the type cannot: `durationSelfMs`, `fileSizeBytes`.
3. **`total` always means "including children", `self` always means "excluding them".** Never "summed
   across rows". A log's duration *is* its root frame's, so `durationTotalMs` names it at every scope,
   and the parser's own `duration.total` / `duration.self` reach the wire unrenamed.
4. **One name per fact, in every tool.** A word may still serve two unrelated facts where position
   prevents confusion: `limit` is both the input row count and the column naming which governor limit
   a row is about.
5. **Counts are `<singularNoun>Count`**: `soqlCount`, `dmlRowCount`. Not `totalX`, not a plural alone.
6. **lowerCamel, acronyms folded**: `soqlCount`.
7. **Booleans are bare adjectives that read true**: `truncated`, `succeeded`. No `isX`, no `hasX`.
8. **An input names what it limits, on the axis it acts on**: `limit`, `minSelfMs`. `minDuration`
   filtered on total time while the ranking used self time, and the name hid it.

## ✂️ Shaping Tool Responses

Every token a tool returns is a token the agent cannot spend on reasoning, so responses are kept as
small as they can be - but the saving has to come from *shape*, never from dropping a fact. If a user
asks "how many DML statements did this transaction consume?", the agent has to be able to answer from
the payload alone.

### Restructure before you delete

Flattening a nested object into a TOON table is almost always a bigger win than deleting rows from
it, and it costs nothing. Measured on the 13 governor limits of a real 19 MB log:

| `governorLimits`, 13 entries | tokens | can answer "0 DML statements"? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nested objects, all 13 | ~151 | yes |
| Nested objects, `used > 0` only | ~42 | **no** |
| **Flat table (`{limit, used, max}`), all 13** | **~84** | yes |

The flat table is 45% cheaper than the nested form *and* complete. Deleting the zero rows buys 42
more tokens and costs the answer, so we don't. `toLimitRows` is the helper that does this.

Per-namespace usage is the exception that proves the rule. `toNamespaceLimitRows` reports only the
limits a namespace consumed, because there a row *is* an occurrence: whether a limit was measured at
all is a property of the transaction, which the whole-log table already answers, so a namespace with
no row for a limit consumed none of it. It states no ceiling either - the parser keeps one ceiling
per limit for the whole transaction, and it is already in `governorLimits`.

### The conventions

The helpers in [`src/tools/responseShaping.ts`](src/tools/responseShaping.ts) exist to make these
one-liners.

- **A fixed-schema field is always reported, even at zero.** The set of governor limits, debug
  categories and method columns is fixed and known, so a zero is a fact and an absent key is an
  ambiguity - the reader cannot tell "nothing ran" from "never parsed". Report the zero.
- **Only occurrence lists are omitted when empty** - issues found, errors
  encountered. There, absence is unambiguous: nothing occurred. `omitEmpty` is for these and nothing
  else; never pass a fixed-schema scalar through it. (`false` is *not* empty - it is an answer.)
- **Say it once.** Never restate in prose a figure that is already in a table, and never report a
  value in two sections. Where prose
  carried a fact the table could not, replace it with a scalar rather than deleting it -
  `topMethodsSelfPercentage` is ~8 tokens where the paragraph it replaced was ~55.
- **Don't state what the caller can derive.** A sentence earns its tokens only if it carries a fact the
  numbers do not. "No bottlenecks found" follows from an always-present empty list, so the fix is a
  complete shape, not a sentence; "High CPU usage - consider optimizing algorithms" follows from the
  percentage beside it. Advice built from one column and a hardcoded threshold is a worse copy of what
  the agent does anyway, because the agent reads every column.
- **Take the bounded view, and cap what is still unbounded inside it.** Where the parser offers
  both, read the deduped one: `logIssues` holds one entry per failure, where `exceptions` holds every
  occurrence - 4,501 throws in one real log are three messages. Then cap the free text that is left,
  because its size is the log's to choose and not ours: a fatal states 53 characters of message on
  the median log and 1,070 on the worst, and one stack runs to 52,009. A field the log controls is a
  field that will one day fill the caller's context. Where the caller also chooses how many rows come
  back, cap the payload and not the count: `apexlog_list_slow_operations` elides a row's `name` past
  400 characters and stops a page at 60,000, because a row cap is a proxy - capping every name still
  left 5 logs of 124 over a client's ceiling, since a thousand rows cost some 15,000 tokens in their
  numeric columns alone. Returning fewer rows than were asked for is the honest answer, and the
  matched count beside them already says the page was cut.
- **Don't echo the input back.** If the caller supplied it (a file path, a flag), it does not belong
  in the response.
- **Round to the precision someone acts on.** `roundMs` for durations (3dp, keeps microsecond
  resolution) and `roundPercent` for percentages (1dp). Raw float division produces things like
  `62.569866677679975`, and every one of those digits is a token nobody reads.
- **Keep table rows identical in shape.** TOON emits one header plus one line per row only while the
  rows agree on their keys, so a column is either present on every row or on none.
- **Report the fact, not the advice.** A tip is a rule applied to a fact the caller cannot see. Report
  the fact instead and let the agent apply its own rule: `outputDirCreated` is 4 tokens where the
  ".gitignore" sentence it replaced was ~15, and it answers the question either way.
- **Say in the tool description what is omitted and when.** Currently that is one sentence per tool,
  because there is one omission per tool.
- **Encode with the TOON defaults.** Measured, none of the alternatives pay:
  - `indentSize: 1` - saves 2.4%, but `decode` rejects it without a matching `indentSize`.
  - keyed tabular (`[n:]`) - costs one character per row, `,` becoming `: `.
  - `delimiter` tab or pipe - 2 tokens on a 9,365-token response. Quoting comes from `:` in a name.
  - nested field groups - nothing left to fold; every table is already flat.

### A scalar qualifies the response, a column varies per row

**A fact that qualifies every number in the response is a response-level scalar, stated once; a fact
that varies per row is a column.** `threshold` on `apexlog_list_limit_risks` follows this rule, and so
does `capturedAt` - the level each debug log category was captured at - which
`apexlog_list_slow_operations` and `apexlog_list_limit_risks` report from the log's header. It is a
table rather than a set of scalars because it is keyed the way the rows are, on `debugCategory`, so
the two join; and each tool names only the categories its own figures came from, since a level for a
category nothing here was logged under qualifies nothing. `apexlog_search_events` names only the
categories its query fixes - the `debugCategory` filter, or the matches' when every `type` named
matched or one event was asked for - and otherwise, or when those hold no declared category, every
declared level, because a category with no match may have none only because its level did not
capture it.

They matter because a capture level silently changes what every figure beside it means. On a log
taken at `APEX_CODE,ERROR` no `METHOD_ENTRY` is emitted at all, so the ranking puts 8,161 ms of self
time on a Visualforce page. That is not the page's work - it is everything the level hid, pooled at
the nearest logged boundary. Without the level the number reads as a finding, and any advice built on
it is confidently wrong.

Two consequences:

- **A level the header never declared is never defaulted.** A level has no zero, so the usual
  "report the fixed-schema field anyway" does not apply - naming a default would state a value the
  log never did. `capturedAt` leaves the category out; `apexlog_get_summary`, whose rows are the
  fixed eleven, states the level empty. Both mean unstated.
- **No caveat prose and no magnitude.** The response reports the level and stops. A figure measured
  once against one org, with the harness not committed, cannot be re-derived by CI and will rot.

`apexlog_get_summary` states the level as a column of `categories`, beside the time each category
took. Two tables keyed on `debugCategory` in the same order named every category twice and left the
join to the caller.

### When a fact earns a grouping and not a column

`namespace` on an operation is the namespace of the frame, which is not always the namespace that
asked for the work. `DMLBeginLine` pins `namespace = "default"` however the DML was reached, while
`SOQLExecuteBeginLine` and `SOSLExecuteBeginLine` carry no namespace logic at all and so inherit the
caller's. The caller is a second fact, and `Operation.callerNamespace` holds it.

It is read off the **direct parent event**, not off the nearest ancestor that ranks as an operation.
Measured over 298 real logs and 1,178,604 operations the two readings agree on every row, because
the parser copies a namespace down to every child that has none. The only rows where they could
diverge are the 289 whose parent is the `EXECUTION_STARTED` frame, and that frame is `default`. So
the reading is the cheaper one to reason about rather than a different answer: it holds even if the
set of frames the ranking skips grows.

It does not earn a column. Measured over two real logs:

| log | rows | caller differs |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| 19 MB, managed packages throughout | 2,469 | 72 (**2.9%**) |
| 39 MB, every category at `INFO` | 39,415 | 2 (**0.0%**) |

Flows, SOQL, workflow and methods differ on **0%** of rows. The *time* sits entirely in the rows that
do differ: DML differs on 4 of 5 rows carrying 934 of its 944 ms, and `codeUnit` on 17% of rows
carrying 10,600 of its 10,904 ms. So the fact matters and the column does not - it would repeat
`namespace` on 97% of every response.

`groupBy: "callerNamespace"` asks the question instead, for one enum value and the clause that says
what it attributes. Every response that does not pass it is unchanged. The rule: **a fact worth an
answer but not worth a column belongs in a parameter that reshapes the rows, not in the rows.**

Heap goes one step further and earns a **sort key, plus the column and scalar only that key carries**.
On the 40 logs of a 123-log corpus that record an allocation, a ranking by the net heap each row's own
code retained holds a median 6 of 10 rows the self-time ranking never returns, and a different top row
on 31 of the 40, so the answer is not derivable from the default response. But only 1 of the 103 logs
that state a heap limit passes half of it, so permanent fields would be zeros on two thirds of
responses for a one-in-a-hundred question. `sortBy: "heapSelfNetBytes"` asks for all three together,
and `durationSelfMaxMs` under `groupBy` is the same shape. This is the boundary of the fixed-schema
rule: **a field the caller's own parameter turns on is not an omission, because the parameter says
which it is.**

The scalar it turns on, `returnedHeapPercentage`, follows the rule two sections above: a share the
returned rows carry qualifies the whole response rather than any one row. It earns its place because
neither the rows nor another tool can imply it - the figures are on the field itself in
[`listSlowOperations.ts`](src/tools/listSlowOperations.ts).

### The gate

Output changes are checked by [`pnpm run eval`](tests/eval/README.md), which drives the built server
over stdio against committed fixtures and asserts four things per (tool, fixture): that realistic
user questions are still answerable, that no figure appears twice, that the payload is under a token
budget, and that it matches its golden file. Run it - and `pnpm run eval:update` to re-record the
goldens - for any change to a response shape; the golden diff *is* the review of the change.

Further checks run once per run: the definition budgets in [`scripts/eval.mjs`](scripts/eval.mjs),
and the generated README blocks - both
[Token Cost](README.md#token-cost) tables, each tool's parameter table, and the shape of each
response. A change that moves any of them fails until `pnpm run eval:update` regenerates the README
with it, so the prose beside those blocks is the only part you edit by hand.

The unit tests cannot substitute for it: jest maps `@toon-format/toon` to a JSON stand-in, so it
never sees the real encoding.

If you change a tool's output shape, update the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) and the tool's entry in the
[README](README.md#tools-reference) - the output contract is part of the public API.

## 🏷️ Shaping Tool Definitions

A definition is charged on every request, called or not. Server `instructions` are charged once per
session, a response only when the tool is called. So a fact true of every tool belongs in
`instructions`, and a fact true of one belongs in that tool's description.

The [MCP spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/latest/server/tools) covers the
rest - what `title`, `description` and each annotation are for. Where it is silent, `pnpm run eval`
is the rule, not this file: it measures every wire object in a live `tools/list` and fails with the
reason. Read `scripts/eval.mjs` for the current budgets, and the definition tests in `tests/` for
the annotations, which no budget with headroom would notice coming back.

One trade a budget cannot see: a description is a selection prompt, so a trim that saves tokens can
cost discovery. `SELECTION_KEYWORDS` makes that fail loudly instead of passing quietly.

## 🧪 Testing Your Changes

Make sure your changes don’t break anything. If you’re working on a feature or bug fix that requires tests, be sure to add or update the relevant tests.

Run Tests Locally:
If you have added or modified tests, you can run them with:

```zsh
pnpm test
```

or run the tests from the test explorer in VScode

If you changed anything a tool returns, also run the evaluation suite against the built server:

```zsh
pnpm run build && pnpm run eval
```

Ensure all tests pass before submitting your pull request.

## 🚢 Releasing

Publishing a release publishes to npm. `.github/workflows/publish.yml` runs on `release: published`, and `scripts/release-tag.mjs` decides which npm **dist-tag** the version goes under.

A dist-tag is a pointer to one version. `latest` is the one that matters, because `npm install @certinia/apex-log-mcp`, `@latest` and `npx` all follow it - and every documented client setup starts this server through `npx`. A prerelease published under `latest` reaches every user on their next run, and the only way back is to publish again.

So the version chooses the channel:

| Version           | dist-tag | Installed with |
| ----------------- | -------- | -------------- |
| `2.0.0`           | `latest` | `@certinia/apex-log-mcp` |
| `2.0.0-beta.1`    | `beta`   | `@certinia/apex-log-mcp@beta` |
| `2.0.0-alpha.1`   | `alpha`  | `@certinia/apex-log-mcp@alpha` |
| `2.0.0-rc.1`      | `rc`     | `@certinia/apex-log-mcp@rc` |

`alpha`, `beta` and `rc` are the only prerelease identifiers accepted; any other fails the release rather than create a dist-tag nobody would ask for.

### Publishing a beta

Nothing changes in the release flow itself. The version string picks the channel, and the pre-release tick has to agree with it.

1. Bump the version, without a local tag - GitHub creates the tag when the release is published:

   ```zsh
   pnpm version premajor --preid beta --no-git-tag-version   # 1.0.0 -> 2.0.0-beta.0
   ```

2. Commit and push it to `main`.
3. Draft a new GitHub release, and create the tag `2.0.0-beta.0` on publish, as usual.
4. **Tick “Set as a pre-release”.** This is the only new step.
5. Publish. The workflow reads the tag, resolves `beta`, and publishes there.
6. Check the pointers: `npm dist-tag ls @certinia/apex-log-mcp`. `latest` must still be the last stable.

Later betas come from `pnpm version prerelease --no-git-tag-version`, and the stable release from `pnpm version major --no-git-tag-version`, which drops the identifier - and then the tick comes off.

To see the dist-tag before you tag anything:

```zsh
RELEASE_TAG=2.0.0-beta.0 PRERELEASE=true node scripts/release-tag.mjs
```

### When the release is refused

The check runs before the install, and long before the publish, so a refused release leaves npm untouched. Correct the version or the tick and release again.

Re-running the failed job does not help: a re-run replays the original event, so it carries the same pre-release flag that failed. Delete the release and create it again - the git tag can stay, and the new release selects it instead of creating it.

### The changelog

`## [Unreleased]` stays as it is through the betas. A beta is a preview of the same unreleased content, not its own set of changes; the heading becomes `## [2.0.0] - <date>` when the stable release is tagged.
